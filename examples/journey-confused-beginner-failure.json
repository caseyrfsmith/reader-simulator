This guide gives you the foundational knowledge you need to get started with your Payabli integration. Taking the time to read through this page now to get oriented can help you get started even faster with Payabli.\n\nThis guide starts off with the basic process between signing up with Payabli and getting your first merchant on board. Then, in Learn the lingo, we cover some Payabli concepts that people new to Payabli may have trouble understanding at first. In the Tokens and test accounts section, we briefly cover some tools you’ll need to build and test your integration.\n\nOkay, let’s get started.\n\nThe basics, start to finish\n\nYour goal with Payabli is to go live, onboard your merchants, and start monetizing your money in and money out transactions. The process between signing up and going live looks like this:\n\n1\nChoose integration style\n\nPayabli offers a couple of ways to integrate with our products. You can pick one, or you can use a hybrid approach. These options have different required resources, security implications, features, and integration challenges.\n\nDirect access APIs\n\nAccept payments, manage customers and subscriptions, build products, address payment disputes, and onboard merchants while maintaining total control over your user experience. This method may require more work from you to meet PCI compliance.\n\nPrebuilt embedded UI components\n\nSeamlessly embed intuitive payment forms that securely capture payment data to generate a token. The token replaces sensitive cardholder or bank account data you can use with the direct access APIs to make transactions. This method dramatically reduces the PCI compliance footprint, with minimal impact to the customer experience.\n\nReporting and statistics APIs\n\nUse webhooks to receive near real-time notifications of events happening on a processing account. Use webhooks alongside the Query API to let software partners to pull detailed payments data from the Payabli platform. You can also use the statistics API to build rich dashboards and analytics into your system.\n\n2\nBuild, test, go live\n\nDuring your integration kickoff, we give you access to the sandbox environment. You’ll learn more in your integration kickoff, but the idea is to use the sandbox to build Payabli into your product and test it.\n\nThe sandbox lets you:\n\nMake test payments.\nSimulate boarding paypoints and managing a portfolio.\nCustomize Payabli’s embedded components to mimic your UX.\nSet up payment devices and test card-present transactions.\nExperiment with reports and notifications.\n\nThe docs can really help you understand what features are available to you and how you can include them with your integration.\n\nAfter you’ve tested thoroughly, our solution engineering team certifies your integration and gives you production access.\n\n3\nBoard merchants\n\nWhen your integration is live, you can start boarding merchants. Merchants must apply using a boarding link that’s generated from a boarding template, when they submit the form, it becomes a boarding application, and Payabli works on underwriting and will either approve or deny the merchant. When approved, a boarding application converts the merchant into a paypoint, which can then process payments with Payabli.\n\nThis is just barely scratching the surface of the merchant boarding process, so see Board Merchants to learn more.\n\nLearn the lingo\n\nBefore you start building, we recommend that you get to know some of Payabli’s terminology by reading the comprehensive glossary. Let’s go over the terms you’ll see a lot during your integration.\n\nEntities\n\nEntities make up Payabli’s hierarchy. You add and manage entities with PartnerHub and the API. Entities include paypoints, organizations, customers, and vendors.\n\nPaypoints are merchants.\nOrganizations are used group and manage paypoints.\nCustomers are the people spending money with your merchants.\nVendors are the folks you and your paypoints pay for goods and services (like the carpet cleaners, office supply folks, and so on).\n\nThis is just a high-level overview of entities, so you can learn more about them in the Entities guide.\n\nEntrypoint\n\nEntrypoint, entry, and entry name all come up a lot during your integration journey. An entrypoint is a Payabli-generated alias that identifies a paypoint or organization. When you make an API call, we use the entry value to identify the paypoint or organization the request should belong to, and almost every request includes an entrypoint value.",

You need a Payabli sandbox account to do any testing.\n\nPay In\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay In features in the sandbox environment.\n\nProcess transactions\n\nYou can create transactions with the API or Payabli’s embedded components. To create a transaction via the API, see Make a sale transaction. To create a transaction via Payabli’s embedded components, see Embedded components overview.\n\nYou can simulate declined transactions in the sandbox environment by using Payabli’s provided test cards. See test accounts for more information.\n\nCancel transactions\n\nYou can cancel a transaction in the sandbox environment by voiding, refunding, or reversing it:\n\nVoid: If the transaction isn’t settled, you can void it to prevent the transaction from settling.\nRefund: If the transaction is settled, you can refund it and send the money back to the account holder.\nReversal: Automatically void or refund the transaction based on settlement status.\n\nSee Cancel a pay in transaction for more information on cancelling transactions. By default, transactions are settled at 9:00 PM UTC daily. If you want to change the time that transactions are settled, contact your Payabli solutions engineer.\n\nHandle disputes\n\nChargebacks and ACH returns are dispute events that occur when a customer disputes a transaction in a production environment. To test chargebacks and ACH returns in the sandbox environment, follow these steps:\n\n1\nCreate a webhook notification\n\nCreate a webhook notification for the ReceivedChargeback or ReceivedAchReturn event. See Manage notifications for more information.\n\n2\nCreate webhook handling logic\n\nYour app should handle the webhook notification when it’s received via an HTTP request. This includes parsing the notification data and triggering behavior based on the event type.\n\n3\nTrigger the webhook event\n\nContact your Payabli solutions engineer to trigger a chargeback or ACH return in the sandbox environment. This sends a webhook notification to your app that you can handle. In a production environment, these events are automatically triggered when a customer disputes a transaction.\n\nTest payment funding statuses\n\nAll pay in transactions have a payment funding status. The payment funding status indicates where a transaction is in the settlement process. Transactions in the sandbox environment automatically progress through the following funding statuses:\n\nPending - This transaction is in an open batch.\nIn Transit - This transaction is in a closed batch that’s being routed to the banks.\nTransferred - The funds are being transferred to the merchant’s bank account.\nFunded (settled) - The funds are in the merchant’s bank account.\n\nIf you need to test how your app handles the following funding statuses, contact your Payabli solutions engineer:\n\nException\nACH Return or Chargebacks\nHeld\nReleased\n\nSee Payment funding status for more information.\n\nPay Out\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Out features in the sandbox environment.\n\nHandle payouts\n\nPayouts are expenses that you pay to your vendors. In Payabli, there are two steps for handling payouts:\n\nAuthorizing - Reserves funds for a payout.\nCapturing - Flags authorized funds for batch processing.\n\nAfter a payout is authorized, the funds are reserved and can’t be used for other payouts. After a payout is captured, the funds are transferred to the vendor’s bank account during the next batch processing window. To learn more about handling payouts, see Manage payouts with the API.\n\nManage vendors\n\nVendors are entities that receive funds from your payouts. You can reference vendors in payouts and bills to organize and track expenses. Before you can reference a vendor in a payout or bill, you must create the vendor. See Manage vendors with the API for more information on creating and managing vendors.\n\nManage bills\n\nIn Payabli, bills represent a bill from a vendor that a paypoint is expected to pay. To create a bill via the API, see Create bill. After you’ve created a bill, you can approve it for payment, update it, or delete it. See Manage bills with the API for more information.\n\nPay Ops\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Ops features",

API tokens are used for authentication, and payment method tokenization exchange sensitive payment method information for secure tokens.\n\nYour API tokens carry privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Don’t share your private API tokens in public areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or public domains.\n\nWhen you authenticate to the API, send the API token in the request header with the key requestToken.\n\nExample header\n$\t  curl --request POST \\\n>\t      --url 'https://api-sandbox.payabli.com/api/Endpoint'\\\n>\t      --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n>\t      --header 'content-type: application/*+json' \\\n>\t      --header 'requestToken: <API token>'\n\nYou must make all API requests over HTTPS. API requests without authentication will fail.\n\nCreate and manage API tokens\n\nYou can create and manage your own API tokens in PartnerHub.\n\nNavigate to Developers > API Tokens, then click Create API Token.\nIn the modal, configure your API token. See the configuration options table below.\nWhen finished, save your work.\nConfiguration option\tDescription\nToken Mode\tPublic tokens are for embedded components, including Creator components. Private tokens are for Payabli APIs and payment devices.\nToken Type\tThe organization API token type is the most commonly used, and gives partners and paypoints access to most endpoints. The application API token is more advanced, and is used for authentication and managing entities. You rarely need to use an application API token. See the API Token Types section for more information.\nToken Lifetime\tAPI tokens can have a lifetime of between 1 and 24 months. Remember that you can delete unused or compromised API tokens at any time from the dashboard.\nIP Restrictions\tUse this option to create an allowlist of IP addresses that can make requests with this API token. Leaving this option blank allows all IP addresses to make requests with this API token.\nCreator Token?\tSelect Yes to use this API token with Creator components. The API token type must be Public. Creator API tokens require that you configure domain restrictions.\nDomain Restrictions\tOnly available with Creator API tokens. For security, you must add the domains that you embed Creator components on. For example, if they’re embedded on https://app.myproduct.com, then add https://app.myproduct here.\nDescription\tA descriptive name for the API token. This description appears in the dashboard and helps identify the API token.\n\nTo view or delete API tokens, navigate to Developers > API Tokens, then click the Action column of a token you want to manage.\n\nAPI token types\n\nTo enhance security, Payabli has several different types of API token, each with different scopes and lifetime.\n\nOrganization API token (most common)\nApplication API token\nUser API token\nTemporary API token\nEnvironments\n\nPayabli offers two environments: a sandbox environment for development and a production environment to bring your Payabli integration live.\n\nSandbox\n\nUse the sandbox environment to build your payments integration without having to charge actual payments and settle bank accounts. Test and run unlimited transactions and play around with Payabli’s tools to build your application.\n\nPayabli Client Success and Development Support give you your sandbox API token after your integration kickoff call.\n\nSandbox API URL: https://api-sandbox.payabli.com/api\n\nProduction\n\nUse the production environment to go live with your integration. Transactions in this environment charge payors and create actual settlements into bank accounts. This environment also lets you create bills and send them for actual payment.\n\nMake sure you have completed extensive testing before launching. Reach out to the Payabli team to make sure you’re ready to launch.\n\nProduction API URL: https://api.payabli.com/api\n\nRate limits\n\nFor security and fraud prevention, Payabli applies two different kinds of rate limits: request limits, and transaction limits (also known as fraud controls).\n\nPayabli reserves the right to alter rate limits in case of security concerns, and wi",

You need a Payabli sandbox account to do any testing.\n\nPay In\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay In features in the sandbox environment.\n\nProcess transactions\n\nYou can create transactions with the API or Payabli’s embedded components. To create a transaction via the API, see Make a sale transaction. To create a transaction via Payabli’s embedded components, see Embedded components overview.\n\nYou can simulate declined transactions in the sandbox environment by using Payabli’s provided test cards. See test accounts for more information.\n\nCancel transactions\n\nYou can cancel a transaction in the sandbox environment by voiding, refunding, or reversing it:\n\nVoid: If the transaction isn’t settled, you can void it to prevent the transaction from settling.\nRefund: If the transaction is settled, you can refund it and send the money back to the account holder.\nReversal: Automatically void or refund the transaction based on settlement status.\n\nSee Cancel a pay in transaction for more information on cancelling transactions. By default, transactions are settled at 9:00 PM UTC daily. If you want to change the time that transactions are settled, contact your Payabli solutions engineer.\n\nHandle disputes\n\nChargebacks and ACH returns are dispute events that occur when a customer disputes a transaction in a production environment. To test chargebacks and ACH returns in the sandbox environment, follow these steps:\n\n1\nCreate a webhook notification\n\nCreate a webhook notification for the ReceivedChargeback or ReceivedAchReturn event. See Manage notifications for more information.\n\n2\nCreate webhook handling logic\n\nYour app should handle the webhook notification when it’s received via an HTTP request. This includes parsing the notification data and triggering behavior based on the event type.\n\n3\nTrigger the webhook event\n\nContact your Payabli solutions engineer to trigger a chargeback or ACH return in the sandbox environment. This sends a webhook notification to your app that you can handle. In a production environment, these events are automatically triggered when a customer disputes a transaction.\n\nTest payment funding statuses\n\nAll pay in transactions have a payment funding status. The payment funding status indicates where a transaction is in the settlement process. Transactions in the sandbox environment automatically progress through the following funding statuses:\n\nPending - This transaction is in an open batch.\nIn Transit - This transaction is in a closed batch that’s being routed to the banks.\nTransferred - The funds are being transferred to the merchant’s bank account.\nFunded (settled) - The funds are in the merchant’s bank account.\n\nIf you need to test how your app handles the following funding statuses, contact your Payabli solutions engineer:\n\nException\nACH Return or Chargebacks\nHeld\nReleased\n\nSee Payment funding status for more information.\n\nPay Out\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Out features in the sandbox environment.\n\nHandle payouts\n\nPayouts are expenses that you pay to your vendors. In Payabli, there are two steps for handling payouts:\n\nAuthorizing - Reserves funds for a payout.\nCapturing - Flags authorized funds for batch processing.\n\nAfter a payout is authorized, the funds are reserved and can’t be used for other payouts. After a payout is captured, the funds are transferred to the vendor’s bank account during the next batch processing window. To learn more about handling payouts, see Manage payouts with the API.\n\nManage vendors\n\nVendors are entities that receive funds from your payouts. You can reference vendors in payouts and bills to organize and track expenses. Before you can reference a vendor in a payout or bill, you must create the vendor. See Manage vendors with the API for more information on creating and managing vendors.\n\nManage bills\n\nIn Payabli, bills represent a bill from a vendor that a paypoint is expected to pay. To create a bill via the API, see Create bill. After you’ve created a bill, you can approve it for payment, update it, or delete it. See Manage bills with the API for more information.\n\nPay Ops\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Ops features",

You need a Payabli sandbox account to do any testing.\n\nPay In\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay In features in the sandbox environment.\n\nProcess transactions\n\nYou can create transactions with the API or Payabli’s embedded components. To create a transaction via the API, see Make a sale transaction. To create a transaction via Payabli’s embedded components, see Embedded components overview.\n\nYou can simulate declined transactions in the sandbox environment by using Payabli’s provided test cards. See test accounts for more information.\n\nCancel transactions\n\nYou can cancel a transaction in the sandbox environment by voiding, refunding, or reversing it:\n\nVoid: If the transaction isn’t settled, you can void it to prevent the transaction from settling.\nRefund: If the transaction is settled, you can refund it and send the money back to the account holder.\nReversal: Automatically void or refund the transaction based on settlement status.\n\nSee Cancel a pay in transaction for more information on cancelling transactions. By default, transactions are settled at 9:00 PM UTC daily. If you want to change the time that transactions are settled, contact your Payabli solutions engineer.\n\nHandle disputes\n\nChargebacks and ACH returns are dispute events that occur when a customer disputes a transaction in a production environment. To test chargebacks and ACH returns in the sandbox environment, follow these steps:\n\n1\nCreate a webhook notification\n\nCreate a webhook notification for the ReceivedChargeback or ReceivedAchReturn event. See Manage notifications for more information.\n\n2\nCreate webhook handling logic\n\nYour app should handle the webhook notification when it’s received via an HTTP request. This includes parsing the notification data and triggering behavior based on the event type.\n\n3\nTrigger the webhook event\n\nContact your Payabli solutions engineer to trigger a chargeback or ACH return in the sandbox environment. This sends a webhook notification to your app that you can handle. In a production environment, these events are automatically triggered when a customer disputes a transaction.\n\nTest payment funding statuses\n\nAll pay in transactions have a payment funding status. The payment funding status indicates where a transaction is in the settlement process. Transactions in the sandbox environment automatically progress through the following funding statuses:\n\nPending - This transaction is in an open batch.\nIn Transit - This transaction is in a closed batch that’s being routed to the banks.\nTransferred - The funds are being transferred to the merchant’s bank account.\nFunded (settled) - The funds are in the merchant’s bank account.\n\nIf you need to test how your app handles the following funding statuses, contact your Payabli solutions engineer:\n\nException\nACH Return or Chargebacks\nHeld\nReleased\n\nSee Payment funding status for more information.\n\nPay Out\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Out features in the sandbox environment.\n\nHandle payouts\n\nPayouts are expenses that you pay to your vendors. In Payabli, there are two steps for handling payouts:\n\nAuthorizing - Reserves funds for a payout.\nCapturing - Flags authorized funds for batch processing.\n\nAfter a payout is authorized, the funds are reserved and can’t be used for other payouts. After a payout is captured, the funds are transferred to the vendor’s bank account during the next batch processing window. To learn more about handling payouts, see Manage payouts with the API.\n\nManage vendors\n\nVendors are entities that receive funds from your payouts. You can reference vendors in payouts and bills to organize and track expenses. Before you can reference a vendor in a payout or bill, you must create the vendor. See Manage vendors with the API for more information on creating and managing vendors.\n\nManage bills\n\nIn Payabli, bills represent a bill from a vendor that a paypoint is expected to pay. To create a bill via the API, see Create bill. After you’ve created a bill, you can approve it for payment, update it, or delete it. See Manage bills with the API for more information.\n\nPay Ops\n\nThis section explains how to test Payabli’s Pay Ops features",
