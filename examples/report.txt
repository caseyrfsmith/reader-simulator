💡 Successful BUT Could Be Better:
   1 journey(s) found answers but content style wasn't ideal

1. [docs.payabli.com] API requests are authenticated by sending the API token in the request header with the key 'requestToken'.
   Persona: efficient-developer (2 steps)
   Goal: Figure out how to authenticate API requests
   Content style: acceptable
   Gap: Needed a quick reference section with header format examples and sample curl commands instead of scattered explanatory text
   💡 Fix: Add a dedicated 'Authentication Quick Reference' section with code examples showing exact header syntax and sample requests
   Impact: high


🔴 Documentation Issues Found:

1. [docs.payabli.com] The user got stuck in a loop between overview pages that mentioned authentication but never showed the actual implementation details or code examples.
   Persona: confused-beginner
   Goal: Figure out how to authenticate API requests
   Outcome: timeout
   Missing: Step-by-step authentication tutorial with actual code examples showing how to include API tokens in request headers, plus copy-paste examples in different programming languages.
   💡 Fix: Create a dedicated 'Authentication Quick Start' page with complete code examples and move it to the top of the navigation structure.
   💥 Impact: Beginners waste time clicking through multiple pages without finding actionable information they can immediately implement in their code.
